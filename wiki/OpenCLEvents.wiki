||*Command State* || *Description* ||

||CL_SUBMITTED || Command has been submitted to device ||
||CL_RUNNING || Command is currently executing on device ||
||CL_COMPLETE || Command has finished execution ||

{{{

cl_int clEnqueueNDRangeKernel (
    cl_command_queue queue,
    cl_kernel kernel, cl_uint work_dim,
    const size_t *global_work_offset,
    const size_t *global_work_size,
    const size_t *local_work_size,
    cl_uint num_events_in_wait_list,
    const cl_event *event_wait_list,
