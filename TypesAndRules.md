# Introduction #

The problem is that I need to find a way to define rules with clEnqueueMapBuffer and type casting.


# Details #

For example, In clsurf we define a rule that says check for feature count.
  * The feature count could be a int / float.
  * Define seperate functions for each one I guess ?

Still thinking...
